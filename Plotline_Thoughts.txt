- As a general thought for the plotline, I thought about it being like the mantis shrimp is fighting depression, hence why he needs to reach the top of the water and break through.

- Matt and I considered the idea that the little guy collects the trash from the water as he goes, as a metaphor for kinda like picking up the pieces to clean up your thoughts.

- I thought it would be a cool idea to have the angler fish following or chasing after the little guy in the first level, as a symbol for being unable to avoid your anxieties or bad thoughts.

- Matt provided the idea that the creature changes as you move through the stages. So, while it starts as an angler fish, it becomes an eel for the coral reef and a shark for the kelp forest.

- When he breaks through the surface, he can throw away the trash he collected throughout the game.

- Maybe when he reaches the surface of the water, his family or friend is there with a hand for him to take, symbolizing him finally getting the acceptance and support he needs to get better.



**He wants to get to the surface/overcome his anxieties/overcome depression; However, he needs the acceptance/support of whoever helps him out of the water at the end.**

* I really liked this song for the very end when he breaks through the surface of the water as a nice pick me up from the darker theme, especially to like a sunrise.*

* I really liked this song for the general music to be played throughout the game. It holds a more melancholy tune, which I think really drives the sad ambience forward, making it more impactful when the music changes.*
